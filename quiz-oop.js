Sometimes the restaurant views through the lens of not being disabled themselves, not realizing both the obvious and subtle challenges created by inaccessibility. Per the ADA, restaurants need to have entrances that are 36 inches across to accommodate a wheelchair; check-out counters must have one section no higher than 36 inches for the same reason. When seating is provided, like in restaurants, at least five percent of those tables must be accessible."

            When Congress passed The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 it didn’t just help the 
            58 million plus disabled Americans it helped us all and continues to help us all.
            All of this has led to a better general understanding of how disability affects someone’s experience,
            and what still needs to be done to create an inclusive environment for everyone. <br/> <br/> The purpose of the quiz is to start 
            discussions about universal design and the importance of access for people in the disability community. 
            This quiz portrays an interactive journey that simulates the stresses of someone not being able to perform 
            a standard activity. As a community we should design with accessibility in mind to create equal opportunities 
            and inclusive environments where everyone can benefit.
